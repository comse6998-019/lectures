Frozen, so nothing mutates it mid-run and two components cannot disagree about
what the budget is. Variants come from `dataclasses.replace`, which keeps the
original intact:

    slow = replace(CONFIG, model="ollama:llama3.1", budget=10)

Paths are properties derived from `root` rather than stored, so overriding
`root` in a test moves every path with it and none can drift out of step.

"""The reactive agent: one run of one alert, start to terminal status.

    with ReactiveAgent(alert, config, trace_path, console) as agent:
        final = agent.execute()

A run is the thing with a lifetime, which is why this is the context manager and
the graph is not. It owns two resources:

    the workspace   a ~11 MB copy of the fixture, made on entry
    the trace       a file handle, opened on entry and closed on exit

Both end together. Before this existed, every run left its workspace behind:
eighteen of them, 198 MB, in one afternoon.

A workspace is kept when the run did not end in `accepted`, and its path is
printed. A run that failed is the one worth opening; a run that succeeded is
11 MB nobody will read again. V3 depends on this, because a deliberately
rejected attempt has to survive for inspection.

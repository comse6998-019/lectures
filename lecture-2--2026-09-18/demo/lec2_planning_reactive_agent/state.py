"""The state record every version shares, and its reducers.

This is the schema handed to `StateGraph(AgentState)`.

A node never mutates state. It returns a dict of proposed changes, and LangGraph
merges each key into the running state. How a key merges is decided by its
reducer: a field with no reducer is replaced, a field annotated with one is
combined by calling it. Reducers are LangGraph's to call, never yours.

Fields fall into two lifetimes here:

    identity    set once, never changed     alert, repo, commit, workspace
    run-local   built up as the run goes    messages, observations, candidate_patch,
                                            usage, model_calls, status

Each later version adds the fields it actually populates: V2 brings `plan` with
the planner that writes it, V3 brings `validation` with the validator, and V4
brings `reflections` and `attempt` along with the machinery to clear run-local
fields between attempts. A field arrives with the node that fills it, so the
diff between two versions shows one change, not a field that was always there
waiting.

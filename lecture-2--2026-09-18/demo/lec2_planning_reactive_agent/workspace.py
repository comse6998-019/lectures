"""A disposable copy of the fixture, with the benchmark's answers withheld.

    with AgentWorkspace(config, case="BenchmarkTest00283") as ws:
        ...

`AgentWorkspace` owns the lifetime. It copies the fixture on entry, moves the
answer files aside, and on exit puts them back before deciding whether to remove
the tree at all.

WHY THE ANSWERS ARE WITHHELD
OWASP Benchmark ships each weakness twice: a vulnerable case and a safe twin
implementing the same endpoint correctly. 758 of its 1,230 cases are safe ones.
So the correct patch for any alert sits in a sibling file, one grep away, and an
agent that finds it has pattern-matched a neighbour rather than reasoned about
the code. It looks like investigation in the trace and is not.

Measured on the worked alert: with siblings present the agent accepted in five
model calls; with them withheld it diagnosed the bug correctly in words and then
spent its whole budget hunting for an example to copy, and produced no patch.

WHY MOVED, NOT DELETED
Withholding is a loan, not a demolition. Files go to a sibling directory and
come back on exit, which means the tree a human opens after a failed run is
complete, the withheld set is inspectable rather than inferred, and nothing here
can destroy anything even if pointed at a tree that is not a copy.

`helpers/` is deliberately never withheld. Following a value into
`helpers/separate_request.py` is the genuine investigation the lecture wants,
and it is not where the answers live.

`resolve` is the agent's security boundary. Every tool calls it before touching
disk. It is module-level and public on purpose: a boundary every caller must
pass through should not look private.

    reached through the /var -> /private/var symlink and an unresolved root

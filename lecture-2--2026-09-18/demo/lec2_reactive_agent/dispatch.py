"""Request -> validate -> execute -> observation.

This is where execution authority lives. The model *proposes* a tool call; the
runtime executes it, or refuses. Every refusal in the system happens here, in
one place, identically for all five versions.

It is also what owns the observation channel. A model can emit a thought, an
action, and a fabricated observation in one response without ever touching the
environment (EnIGMA calls this "soliloquizing"). Because only the dispatcher
writes observations, an agent reporting a file it never opened is structurally
impossible rather than something the prompt has to prevent.

Not a context manager, deliberately: a `with` block manages a resource lifetime,
and the dispatcher owns no resource. The workspace belongs to the run's state
and the trace closes itself. A class here bundles collaborators, nothing more.
